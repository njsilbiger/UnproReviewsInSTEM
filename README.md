# Unprofessional peer reviews disproportionately harm underrepresented groups in STEM

### Authors: Nyssa J. Silbiger & Amber D. Stubler

### Journal: *PeerJ*

### Link: *in review*


### Data and Scripts

The survey collected no unique personal identifying information beyond basic demographic information. However, respondent anonymity may be jeopardized through revealing specific combinations of the demographic information collected (e.g. field of study, gender, race/ethnicity). Therefore, the data that support the findings of this study are not publically available. Data are available on request from the corresponding author (NJS); however, data will be provided in a modified format to respect the anonymity of respondents.
